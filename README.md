# R3F
Not mine, i just share it with those who want it for Exile.
It comes pre-configured for selling of crates.

# R3F-Crate-Selling
Crate Selling scripts for R3F and Exile. Complete with infiSTAR logging functionality. Join my Discord at http://discord.gamingatdeathsdoor.com if you have any problems.

Original Script found here: http://www.exilemod.com/topic/19038-sell-crates-at-wastedump-r3f-required/ My version, adds the pop tabs to the player, updates the player's respect and deletes the crate from the world. Deleting the crate prevents other players from taking the money.

# Install Instructions
Please follow the install instructions for R3F found here:
http://team-r3f.org/madbull/logistics/EN_DOCUMENTATION.pdf

Pack the gadd_extras folder into a PBO and drop it into your @ExileServer\addons folder.

If you use infiSTAR set _useInfiSTAR to true in mpmission.mapname.pbo\R3F_LOG\objet_deplacable\relacher.sqf

Configure everything else how you want it in the relacher.sqf. Configurable things have comments next to them. DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!!!
